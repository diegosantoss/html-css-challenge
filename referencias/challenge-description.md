# AMARO HTML & CSS challenge

The objective of this challenge is to build a special landing page for one of the _best-sellers_ of AMARO history: The Trench Coat.

**NOTE:** Portuguese version available [here](o-desafio.md).

## Requirements

- The page must be responsive. If possible, use a _mobile-first_ approach.
- The page must be divided into sections, following the layouts.

## How we'll evaluate

- Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, among other factors.
- The `git` history will be evaluated.
- Do not forget documentation. Or how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines? :thinking_face:

## Observations

- Mobile and desktop layouts are inside `mockups` folder.
- Images are inside `assets` folder.
- In case you choose to use some _build_ tool (Grunt, Gulp, npm, Webpack, etc), don't forget to create an instruction guide to allow us to run the project.

## Got questions?

- If you got some questions, Google them or ask your friends. But do not ask them to solve the challenge for you.
- The challenge is harder than you anticipated? Contact us opening an _issue_ and we'll help you through the process.
